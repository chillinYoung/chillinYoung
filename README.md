- 💻 Skills: C, Python, Git, Maya, PyQt, Java, HTML, CSS, JS

- 🐥 Currently learning: C++

- ⚡ Fun facts: 
    - 👧🏻 My name is 'Young', but I am not that much young.
    - 🖥 I started to learn programming after I had learned about node-based rigging for 3D animation with Maya.
          I wanted to do more than just using nodes; however, now I am just having fun with programming. 😂📚 
          (Still, I have a lot of interests in 3D Graphics!)
    - 🚸 My previous degree was in Child Studies.
    - 🇯🇵 I can speak Japanese pretty well, but can barely read or write Japanese! 
          I learned it by chatting with Japanese friends when I was in Japan as an exchange student.
